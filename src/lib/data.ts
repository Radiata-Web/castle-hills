    text: "They just stained my fence and it looks absolutely amazing!!!!  The quality of stain was top tier and brought so much life back to my fence. What I appreciated the most was their attention to detail and care they took in my backyard. I had just remodeled my pool and decking so I was a little nervous about stain getting where it shouldnâ€™t but they took all the necessary precautions. I would HIGHLY recommend Castle Hills Stain & Restoration!",
